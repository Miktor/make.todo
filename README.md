# make.todo
To Do list with full encryption and user plugins.

I use this project to play with different platforms and languages. Don't event try to find and common sense in that infrastructure, it's left this repo right after the creation.
The goal is to use new language for each microservice.

## Overview

- `/back` - forder with microservices
- `/front` - different frontends

I use `React` + `TypeScript` for frontend and plan to use `Electron` for Desktop and Mobile.

For Backend I'll use new language for each service with microservice arhitecture, session authorization, `JSON REST API` for public APIs and RPC for internal communication.

All the data will be hashed to impersonate users.

I will support user provided scripts for custom ToDo functionality.
